* :flushed: - Means I am embarassed
* :smirk: - Means I feel devious

## Keyboard Shortcuts
Shortcuts I use fequently
* Alt-Tab (Alternate between active windows/programs)
* Win-P (Change display settings for multiple monitors)
* Win-L (Locking my PC)

Shortcuts I should use more
* Ctrl-C (I don't know why but I use my mouse, or drag'n'drop)
* Ctrl-X (Cutting command. I am silly and often copy paste then delete the old. Very innefficient)
* Ctrl-A (Select all. I should use this instead of furiously clicking my mouse hoping it will select all)
